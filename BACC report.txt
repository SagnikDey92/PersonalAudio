convolution takes time (160000 elements). We need only first M elements of convolution.
M is order of 1000. Can be made much faster by removing conv().

Results are decent even with just 2 speakers. I'm sure more speakers will improve performance
even further.

Noticed that the H we are using for kalman is not really minimum phase. Generating till
1024 reveals the truth.

Ask for github ID so I can share the code.
